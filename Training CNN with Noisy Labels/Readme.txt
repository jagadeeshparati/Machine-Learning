Train the Convolutional Neural Networks with the Noisy Labels.
Train the CNN by introducing a Linear Noise layer after the softmax layer.

The datasets contains 25 labels that has to be predicted. 

Train the model and evaluate the model using the test data 10 times and the results of each run is placed in the performance excel sheet.
